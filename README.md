# Traffic-advisory-simulation
(Java GUI) This is a simulation of traffic advisory service system

I can't find my C++ curriculum design, so I guess I will just skip it.
Here is a simulation system of traffic advising.

You can run it by importing this project into Eclipse.

As you running it, you can see a welcome page that shows all the city you have created before, or null if it's your first time running it.
Then, you can create a city and put some information of the city by hitting the button "new city". All buttons are self-explainatory 
and very easy to use, so I won't give any other instructions about how to play the program.

As you can notice, the JPanel will become blinking as you dragging a city around, this is caused by the event of calling repaint() in my
JFrame continuously, where I shouldn't done this. But I don't wanna modify it anymore :(, so suck it up :P

I hope you can read Chinese.
